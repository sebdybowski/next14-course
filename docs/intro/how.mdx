# How Next.js is different from React?

:::info
Small recap for those who are not familiar with Next.js. ðŸ˜‰
:::

Although **Next.js** is built on top of **React**, it is not a replacement for it.
It is a library that provides a set of tools to build a React application using a different approach.
Instead of shipping **entire application** to the client, Next.js **pre-renders** the pages on the server.
