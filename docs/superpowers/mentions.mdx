# Honorable mentions
- **Caching Enhancements**: Next.js 14 introduces several caching 
strategies, including request memoization, data caching, 
full route caching, and router caching. 
These strategies help reduce load times and server pressure 
by storing and reusing fetched data efficiently​.

- **Improved Image Optimization**: Enhancements to image optimization 
ensure better handling of images, contributing to faster load times 
and improved performance for web applications​. Source:

- **Revalidation patterns**: Revalidation is the process of purging 
the Data Cache and re-fetching the latest data. This is useful when your 
data changes and you want to ensure you show the latest information.
  - `revalidateTag(tag: string): void;` allows you to purge cached data on-demand 
  for a specific cache tag.
  - `revalidatePath(path: string, type?: 'page' | 'layout'): void;` 
  allows you to purge cached data on-demand for a specific path.
  - `fetch('https://...', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } })`: 
  revalidate fetched data at interval measured in seconds.
