## Build modes
### Traditional mode
In this mode the project is being build by **webpack**.
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  ...
},
```

### Turbo mode
In this mode the project is being build by new in-house vercel solution: **Turbopack** - a bundler written in **Rust**.
```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev --turbo",
  ...
},
```

### Results
- **Traditional mode** - ```✓ Ready in 1483ms.```
- **Turbo mode** - ```✓ Ready in 1212ms.``` - 20% faster

What is more important also **hot-reloading** is faster.


:::danger Turbopack is Dev mode only

Due to a fact that Turbopack is not supporting advanced configuration options 
like webpack does it is possible to use it only in development mode.
