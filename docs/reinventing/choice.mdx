## The hype cycle

### In 2013 (React 1st release) I was riding high on that JS hype. 

## I have to be honest...
...I have become a PHP hater when React.js was released.
I thought everything should be written in JavaScript.

### This was literally me:

### But now I am older and hopefully wiser...
And I have gained some respect for PHP. 

## Architectural possibilities
PHP Ecosystem have evolved drastically in the last years.

## Next.js Pros & Cons
- ✅ Next.js is using the same language on FE and BE. 
Which results in mild learning curve.
- ✅ SSR out of the box
- ✅ Good performance

- ❌ PHP servers are cheaper. You can using almost on any hosting
- ❌ PHP Development is cheaper as well. 😉
- ❌ Next.js is not as mature on the backend side as PHP.
